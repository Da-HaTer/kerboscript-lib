**Meantime
[x]Ascent script: suborbital trajectory equation & insertion loop
[x]aerodynamic pod reentry, control descent with pid (roll control relative to com offset)
[x]fix deltav & debug list was edited (ship:parts) (shit !)
[x]approximate suborbital reentry trajectory mid flight (if reusable)
[x]intercept circular orbit satellites

**Advanced: 
[x]flight telemtry and data science logging
[x]rcs deltav and more advanced parts stage grouping stuff
[x]hoverslam with 3 engines and startup delay time
[x]hover navigate and land (for lunar missions)
[x]Space shuttle launch and landing [landing,trajectory,adv ascent algo (custom pid)]
[x]launch & intercept eleptic satellites, approximate approach with kepler laws instead, hill climb
