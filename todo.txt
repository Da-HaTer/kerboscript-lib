gemini spacecraft:
0)log ship mass
1)get to low kerbin orbit (90 km with 80 inclination)
1.5)log ship mass and delta v to capabilitest.txt
2)deploy antenna  (check which entanna suitable)
3){do we need power saving mode ?
  1000 ec | antenna using 0.13 ec/s
  calculate night time (probably graph it to know intervals of possible heights) give +-20 ec for steering
  >>we have at most 645 seconds of night}

4)can we know when to take science experiments ? (apparently yes (explore this more)) gear: run experiments.Â¨brakes: reset experiments.

5)deorbit burn
	can we estimate when to deorbit so we fall near and ahead of ksc
	or should we use trajectories mod( i think it would be easier to work it out by ourselves (OPTIMISTIC !!))
6)reentry
	can we only control spin (without pid loop)
	or it would be easier to estimate direction anomaly in proprtion to mass offset and build our pid(probably) 			controllers upon it

//additional : heading course divergence trigger function for abort system 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
todo:
test gforce pid loop:
1)get acceleration formula
---------------------------
test maneuver nodes:
1)make a maneuver node
2)warp to maneuver node time (does maneuver time be affected by thrust limit (does thrust limit affect isp or fuel flow))
3)change eccentricity test wihout acting
4)hardest: maneuver target intersept(precise) uses targetat() ?


add boot library of house keeping such as orbit info and sleep(). .

ksp : different values of libraries are acting globally

///add automaticwarp in asent (improve )

//manned : has connection , use old bootscript
//unmanned: plan ahead ()

These PID controller modes have distinct advantages and disadvantages and consequences if one mode dominates. 
Excessive proportional action causes a faltering or hesitation, excessive integral action causes overshoot, 
and excessive derivative action causes an oscillatory approach to setpoint

create take off script dev/plane.ks

///if a parameter is passed and it is variable it doesn't get updated, it has to be manually updated by the function
