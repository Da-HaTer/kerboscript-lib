**Meantime
- [ ] Ascent script: suborbital trajectory equation & insertion loop
    - [ ] Launch window time precision (target orbit)
    - [ ] implement launch azimuth calculation (from python script)
    - [ ] roll program & pitch program (next gen guidance)
    - [ ] account for insufficient burn time to circularize 
- [x] fix deltav & debug list was edited (ship:parts) (shit !)
- [ ] rcs deltav and more advanced parts stage grouping stuff

- [ ] intercept circular orbit satellites
- [ ] launch & intercept eleptic satellites, approximate approach with kepler laws instead, hill climb

**Advanced: 
- [ ] launch to specific orbit given elements
- [ ] flight telemtry and data science logging

- [ ] approximate suborbital reentry trajectory mid flight (if reusable)
- [ ] hoverslam with 3 engines and startup delay time
- [ ] simulate gradual thrust (random intervals)

- [ ] hover navigate and land (for lunar missions)

- [ ] Space shuttle launch and landing [landing,trajectory,adv ascent algo (custom pid)

- [ ] aerodynamic pod reentry, control descent with pid (roll control relative to com offset)
